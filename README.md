# Machine learning data analysis
This is the project to evaluate the prediction accuracy and efficiency of different machine learning algorithms on two different dataset: 1. phishing website 2. diabetes prediction
___
## Supervised learning
In this section, two datasets are trained and validated by these implementations:
* Decision tree
* Adaboost
* K-nearest neighbors
* Supper vector machine
* Neural Network

Details code for analyzing could be found in [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/hoseela41/Machine_learning_data_analysis/tree/main/Supervised_Learning). The comparison of accuracy and efficiency on dataset of diabetes could be concluded in these plots:![Accuracy comparison](https://github.com/hoseela41/Machine_learning_data_analysis/blob/main/Supervised_Learning/accuracy_compare.png?raw=true "Title")![Efficiency comparison](https://github.com/hoseela41/Machine_learning_data_analysis/blob/main/Supervised_Learning/efficiency_compare.png?raw=true "Title")

## Unupervised learning
In this section, two datasets are trained and validated after **dimensionality reduction**, including
* K-means and Expectation Maximization 
* Principle component analysis
* Independent component analysis
* Randomized reduction
* Information gain algorithm

The details of code and analysis could be found in [Unsupervised learning](https://github.com/hoseela41/Machine_learning_data_analysis/tree/main/UnsupervisedLearning_DimensionalityReduction) section.

## Radomize optimization
In this section, diabetes dataset was used for training and validation. The neural network was implemented and the optimization of parameters was done by different approaches, including:
* Genetic algorithms
* Random hill climbing
* Simulating annealing

Besides, three classical problems, N-queens, continuos peak and knapsack problem are also solved by these methods, the performance of different algorithms on different problems is analyzed in [Randomize optimization](https://github.com/hoseela41/Machine_learning_data_analysis/tree/main/Randomize_Optimization) section.

## Reinforcement learning
In this section, two classical problems: [forest management](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjfr-2020-0447) and [frozen lake](https://analyticsindiamag.com/openai-gym-frozen-lake-beginners-guide-reinforcement-learning/) are solved by reinforcement learning algorithms:
* Value iteration
* Policy iteration
* Q-learning

The detail of code and analysis could be find in [Reinforcement learning](https://github.com/hoseela41/Machine_learning_data_analysis/tree/main/Markov%20Decision%20Process) section.
