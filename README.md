# Machine learning data analysis
This is the project to evaluate the prediction accuracy and efficiency of different machine learning algorithms on two different dataset: 1. phishing website 2. diabetes prediction
___
## Supervised learning
In this section, two datasets are trained and validated by these algorithms:
* Decision tree
* Adaboost
* K-nearest neighbors
* Supper vector machine
* Neural Network

Details code for analyzing could be found in [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/hoseela41/Machine_learning_data_analysis/tree/main/Supervised_Learning). The comparison of accuracy and efficiency on dataset of diabetes are shown here:
