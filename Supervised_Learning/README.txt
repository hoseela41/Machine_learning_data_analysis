This is the README file to instruct how to run my code (hlin83) for Supervised Learning assignments (Spring 2021)

1. The information of code and dataset files could be found in public github repo: https://github.com/hoseela41/ML7641/tree/master/Supervised_Learning

2. Two datasets diabetes.csv and phishing.csv could be found from the link in step 1. 

3. There are three jupyter notebooks .ipynb files could be found in the repo, before running the jupyter notebook, please insall the modules of
   numpy, pandas, matplotlib, time, warnings, IPython and sklearn 

	a. diabetes.ipynb: this is the jupyternotebook for performing data preprocessing and testing/optimizing on all five machince learning algorithms on "diabetes.csv"

	b. phishing.ipynb: this is the jupyternotebook for performing data preprocessing and testing/optimizing on all five machince learning algorithms on "phishing.csv"

	c. Analysis_both_datasets.ipynb: From a and b, the optimized parameters for building the best classifier were collected, then the performance and training/testing time comparison are analyzed and compared in this jupyter notebook file

4. hlin83-analysis pdf and docx file for the report. It has to be noted that all plots in the report were saved and could be found in the jupyter notebooks listed in step 3.
