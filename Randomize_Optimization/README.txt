This is the README file to instruct how to run my code (hlin83) for Markov Decision Processes assignment 4 (Spring 2021)

1. The information of code and dataset files could be found in public github repo: https://github.com/hoseela41/ML7641/tree/master/Markov%20Decision%20Process

2. Two datasets diabetes.csv could be found from the link in step 1. 

3. There are 2 jupyter notebooks .ipynb files could be found in the repo, before running the jupyter notebook, please insall the modules of
   numpy, pandas, matplotlib, time, warnings, IPython and sklearn and mlrose_hiive, hiive.mdptoolbox.mdp and gym

	a. FOrest.ipynb: this is the jupyternotebook for performing 4 randomized optimization algorithms on continuous peak problem

	b. Knapsack.ipynb: this is the jupyternotebook for performing 4 randomized optimization algorithms on Knapsack problem

	
4. hlin83-analysis pdf and docx file for the report. It has to be noted that all plots in the report were saved and could be found in the jupyter notebooks listed in step 3.
