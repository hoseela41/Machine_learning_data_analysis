This is the README file to instruct how to run my code (hlin83) for Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction assignment 3 (Spring 2021)

1. The information of code and dataset files could be found in public github repo: https://github.com/hoseela41/ML7641/tree/master/UnsupervisedLearning_DimensionalityReduction

2. Two datasets diabetes.csv could be found from the link in step 1. 

3. There are 6 jupyter notebooks .ipynb files could be found in the repo, before running the jupyter notebook, please insall the modules of
   numpy, pandas, matplotlib, time, warnings, IPython and sklearn 

	a. *Kmeans_EM.ipynb*: this is the jupyternotebook for performing 2 clustering algorithms, K-means and Expectation Maximization

	b. *PCA.ipynb*: this is the jupyternotebook for running principal component analysis

	c. *ICA.ipynb*: this is the jupyternotebook for running independent component analysis

	b. *RP.ipynb*: this is the jupyternotebook for running randomizd projection

	d. *IG.ipynb*: this is the jupyternotebook for running information gain algorithm

	e. *All comparison.ipynb*: this is the jupyternotebook for comparing all a - d algorithms applied in Neural Network model

4. hlin83-analysis pdf and docx file for the report. It has to be noted that all plots in the report were saved and could be found in the jupyter notebooks listed in step 3.
